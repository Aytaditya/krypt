# Krypt: Secure and Transparent Crypto Sending Platform

**Project Overview**

Krypt is a user-friendly platform that empowers you to seamlessly send cryptocurrency between wallets. It leverages the robust security of MetaMask, a leading crypto wallet extension, to ensure a smooth and reliable experience. With Krypt, you can:

- **Connect Your MetaMask Wallet:** Effortlessly connect your MetaMask wallet to Krypt, granting you the ability to send crypto directly from your existing holdings.
- **Send Crypto with Ease:** Enter the recipient's wallet address and the desired amount you wish to send. Krypt streamlines the transaction process, making it swift and convenient.
- **Track Transaction History:** Maintain complete transparency over your crypto transactions. Krypt meticulously stores all your past transactions, allowing you to easily review them whenever needed.

## Note

This lottery system is built using Solidity version 0.8.11.

## Features

- **Blockchain Integration**: Our lottery system is built on blockchain technology, ensuring transparency and security throughout the lottery process. The smart contract manages ticket purchases, prize distribution, and result verification.

- **User-Friendly Frontend**: The frontend interface provides an intuitive platform for users to participate in the lottery, check results, and manage prizes effortlessly. The interface is designed to enhance the overall user experience, making it accessible to both experienced blockchain users and newcomers.

- **Transparency**: With blockchain technology, every transaction and lottery drawing is recorded on the blockchain, providing a transparent and immutable record of the entire lottery process. Users can verify the fairness of the lottery results at any time.


**Project Structure**

Krypt is comprised of two main folders:

- **client:** This folder houses the frontend application codebase built with React and leverages Vite for efficient building and development processes.
- **contract:** This folder contains the Solidity smart contract code that defines the core functionality of Krypt's crypto sending logic. Additionally, it includes a Hardhat setup to facilitate easy deployment of the smart contract to a blockchain network.


**Tech Stack**

Krypt utilizes a modern tech stack to deliver a performant and user-friendly experience:

- **Frontend:** React - A popular JavaScript library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS - A utility-first CSS framework that streamlines the styling process.
- **Smart Contract:** Solidity (version 0.8.19) - A high-level programming language specifically designed for writing smart contracts that can be deployed and run on blockchains.
- **Development Environment:** Hardhat - A comprehensive framework for building, deploying, and testing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Ethers.js - A powerful library that simplifies interaction with the Ethereum blockchain from JavaScript environments.
**Getting Started**


1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Ensure you have MetaMask installed and configured on your browser. You can download it from the official MetaMask website: [https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/).
   - Create a MetaMask account if you haven't already.
   - Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. These are required for both the client-side and contract development.

2. **Setting Up the Development Environment:**
   - Clone the Krypt repository from GitHub (link to be provided).
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd krypt
     ```
   - Install dependencies for the client-side application:
     ```bash
     cd client
     npm install (or yarn install)
     ```
   - Install dependencies for the smart contract:
     ```bash
     cd ../contract
     npm install (or yarn install)
     ```

**Running Krypt Locally**

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm run dev (or yarn dev)
   ```
   This will start the React development server, typically accessible at `http://localhost:5173/` in your browser.

2. **Deploy the smart contract (developers only):**
   Refer to the instructions within the `contract` folder for deploying the smart contract to a test or development blockchain network.

**Security Considerations**

- **MetaMask Security:** Krypt prioritizes security by delegating all wallet management and transaction signing to MetaMask, a well-established and secure crypto wallet extension.
- **Best Practices:** Always adhere to recommended security practices when using cryptocurrencies. These include:
   - Keeping your MetaMask seed phrase confidential (never share it with anyone).
   - Utilizing strong and unique passwords for both Krypt and MetaMask.
   - Being cautious when interacting with dApps (decentralized applications).

**Disclaimer**

Cryptocurrency transactions are irreversible. Please exercise due diligence when sending crypto, as you cannot retrieve funds once a transaction is confirmed. Ensure you have the correct recipient's wallet address before proceeding.

**Contributing**

We welcome contributions from the cryptocurrency community! If you're interested in contributing to Krypt's development, feel free to reach out to the project maintainers (details to be provided in a separate communication channel).
